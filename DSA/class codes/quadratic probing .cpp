/*Problem Statement

Sharon is tasked with implementing a simple hash 
table using quadratic probing to handle collisions.

The hash table will have a fixed size of 10, and she 
needs to read a set of integer keys from the user, hash 
them into the table using quadratic probing, and then display 
the contents of the hash table.

Implement a hash function that calculates the hash index for 
each key using the modulo operation with the table size (10). 
The hash index should be calculated as follows: hashIndex = key % tableSize.

 Input Format 
The first line of input consists of an integer N, 
representing the number of keys to be inserted.

The second line consists of N space-separated integers,
 each representing a key to be inserted into the hash table.

 Output Format 
The output prints the values that have been successfully 
inserted into the hash table.

 Constraints 
table size = 10

 Sample Input  
5
41 52 63 95 83
Sample Output 
41 52 63 83 95 */
