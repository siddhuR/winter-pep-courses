/*Problem Statement

Gopi is working on a project that involves finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
 He needs your help to implement a program that can efficiently 
 find the shortest path between two nodes using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

Write a program to help Gopi implement this functionality. 
The program should take an undirected graph as input and find the shortest path between two given nodes.

 Input Format 
The first line contains an integer, v, representing the number of vertices in the graph.

The second line contains an integer, e, representing the number of edges in the graph.

The next e lines each contain two space-separated integers, src and dest, 
indicating an edge between vertex source and vertex destination.

The last two lines contain two integers, 'source' and 'destination', 
which specify the source and destination nodes for which you need to find the shortest path. 
 
 Output Format 
The output is displayed in the following format:
The first line consists of "Shortest path length is: X", where X represents the shortest path length.

The second line consists of "Path is: ", followed by the nodes in the shortest path, space-separated.
These two lines are separated by a newline character.
